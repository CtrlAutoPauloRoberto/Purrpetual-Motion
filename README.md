# 🐱 Bongo Cat Stealth Mouse Jiggler (ESP32)

A programmable, undetectable mouse jiggler that disguises itself as a cute desktop accessory. It displays an animated **Bongo Cat** GIF while subtly moving the mouse cursor to prevent computer sleep or "Away" status.

(The bluetooth icon changes his color when the bluetooth is connected with the device)

Unlike standard jigglers, this project uses a **human-like (mybe a Cat-like?) movement algorithm** and spoofs the Bluetooth ID of a legitimate Logitech mouse.

## ✨ Key Features

* **👻 Stealth Operation:** Identifies via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a **"Logitech MX Master 3"**.
* **🥁 Visual Feedback:** Plays a smooth Bongo Cat animation on the IPS display.
* **🧠 Humanized Physics:** Instead of robotic zig-zags, the cursor moves in random, smooth curves with variable speeds and pauses, mimicking human behavior.
* **🔵 Custom UI:** Features a custom-drawn, iOS-style Bluetooth status badge (Squircle shape) that updates in real-time.
* **🔄 Auto-Reconnect Watchdog:** Automatically reboots the MCU if the Bluetooth connection drops for more than 30 seconds, ensuring the device is always ready.
* **💡 PWM Brightness Control:** Optimized for **LilyGO T-Display S3** (Pin 38) for a subtle, low-light appearance.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

* **LilyGO T-Display S3** (ESP32-S3 with built-in ST7789 display).
* USB-C Cable.
* (Optional) 3D Printed case for a desktop finish. (You can find one in to printables.com website, one like: https://www.printables.com/model/1476247-lilygo-t-display-s3-amoled-case) 

## 📦 Dependencies

This project is built using the Arduino framework. You will need the following libraries:

1. **[TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI)** (by Bodmer) - *Driver for the display.*
2. **[ESP32-BLE-Mouse](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Mouse)** (by T-vK) - *Bluetooth HID emulation.*
3. **[AnimatedGIF](https://github.com/bitbank2/AnimatedGIF)** (by bitbank2) - *GIF decoding.*

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can tweak the behavior at the top of the `main.cpp` file:


### Movement Settings
```cpp
#define MAX_MOVE_RANGE 15       // Radius of movement (pixels)
#define MOUSE_SPEED_FACTOR 0.05 // Lower = Smoother/Slower
#define MIN_WAIT_TIME 2000      // Min pause between moves (ms)
#define MAX_WAIT_TIME 15000     // Max pause between moves (ms)
